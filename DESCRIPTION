Description: 
    RNAshapeQC provides coverage-shape-based quality control (QC) metrics 
    for mRNA-seq and total RNA-seq data. It supports per-gene pileup 
    construction from BAM files as well as toy datasets for quick-start 
    examples. The package implements protocol-specific metrics, including 
    decay rate (DR), degradation score (DS), mean coverage depth (MCD), 
    window coefficient of variation (wCV), area under the curve (AUC), and 
    shape-based sample-level indices. RNAshapeQC also includes HPC-friendly 
    functions for per-gene batch processing and cross-study pileup generation. 
    This package enables interpretable, protocol-specific QC assessments for 
    diverse RNA-seq workflows.
