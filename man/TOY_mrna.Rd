\title{Toy mRNA-seq-like dataset for RNAshapeQC}
\format{
A list with 6 components:
\describe{
  \item{DR}{A numeric matrix of decay rates; genes in rows and samples in columns.
    In this toy dataset, it is a 100 (genes) x 10 (samples) matrix with
    row names like \code{"Gene001"} and column names like \code{"T01"}.}
  \item{genes}{A character vector of length 100 containing gene IDs used as
    row names in \code{DR} and \code{TPM}.}
  \item{samples}{A character vector of length 10 containing sample IDs used
    as column names in \code{DR} and \code{TPM}.}
  \item{protocol}{A single character string indicating the protocol used,
    here \code{"mRNA-seq"}.}
  \item{TPM}{A numeric matrix of TPM values; same dimension and dimnames
    as \code{DR}.}
  \item{genelength.mat}{A one-column numeric matrix of gene lengths (bp),
    with row names matching the row names of \code{DR}.}
}
}
\usage{
data("TOY_mrna")
}
\value{
A named list containing synthetic mRNA-seq-like inputs for RNAshapeQC.
}
\description{
A small synthetic dataset mimicking mRNA-seq coverage-based quality control
(QC) inputs. It is used in the vignette to demonstrate degradation-based
metrics such as decay rate (DR), degradation score (DS), and the
degraded/intact index (DII).
}
\details{
All values are synthetic and were generated solely for demonstration and
testing. They do not correspond to any real samples or cohorts.
