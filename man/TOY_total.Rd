\title{Toy total RNA-seq-like dataset for RNAshapeQC}
\format{
A list with 5 components:
\describe{
  \item{MCD}{A numeric matrix of mean coverage depth; genes in rows and
    samples in columns. In this toy dataset, it is a 100 (genes) x 10
    (samples) matrix with row names like \code{"Gene001"} and column names
    like \code{"A01"}.}
  \item{wCV}{A numeric matrix of window coefficients of variation; same
    dimension and dimnames as \code{MCD}.}
  \item{genes}{A character vector of length 100 containing gene IDs used as
    row names in \code{MCD} and \code{wCV}.}
  \item{samples}{A character vector of length 10 containing sample IDs used
    as column names in \code{MCD} and \code{wCV}.}
  \item{protocol}{A single character string indicating the protocol used,
    here \code{"total RNA-seq"}.}
}
}
\usage{
data("TOY_total")
}
\value{
A named list containing synthetic total RNA-seq-like inputs for RNAshapeQC.
}
\description{
A small synthetic dataset mimicking total RNA-seq coverage-based quality
control (QC) inputs. It is used in the vignette to demonstrate coverage-shape
metrics such as mean coverage depth (MCD), window coefficient of variation
(wCV), and the suboptimal/optimal index (SOI).
}
\details{
All values are synthetic and were generated solely for demonstration and
testing. They do not correspond to any real samples or cohorts.
