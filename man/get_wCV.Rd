\title{Get a window coefficient of variation for genes and samples (for a genelist)}
\usage{
get_wCV(
  genelist,
  pileupPath,
  sampleInfo,
  rnum = 100,
  method = 1,
  winSize = 20,
  egPct = 10,
  cases = NULL,
  nCores = 32
)
}
\arguments{
\item{genelist}{a vector of gene names}

\item{pileupPath}{file paths of coverage pileupData including .RData file names}

\item{sampleInfo}{a sample information table including sample id. The number of rows is equal to the number of samples.}

\item{rnum}{the number of regions for uniformly dividing the x-axis for gene length normalization. Default is 100.}

\item{method}{1 and 2 return the raw read depth and the interpolated read depth at the normalized genomic position, respectively. Default is 1.}

\item{winSize}{window size of the rolling window. Default is 20.}

\item{egPct}{edge percent (one-side) to calculate the trimmed mean. Default is 10.}

\item{cases}{a vector of specific samples among all samples in pileup. If NULL, all samples are selected. Default is NULL.}

\item{nCores}{the number of cores for parallel computing. Default is 32.}
}
\value{
wCV is a the number of genes x the number of samples matrix.

## NOTE:
## This example demonstrates the function interface only.
## Meaningful results require coverage pileup files generated
## from BAM files (see vignette for a full workflow).
