\title{Get a window coefficient of variation for genes and samples (for a single gene)}
\usage{
gen_wCV(
  Gene,
  pileupPath,
  sampleInfo,
  rnum = 100,
  method = 1,
  winSize = 20,
  egPct = 10,
  cases = NULL,
  Study = NULL,
  outFile
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Gene}{a character of gene name}

\item{pileupPath}{file paths of coverage pileupData including .RData file names}

\item{sampleInfo}{a sample information table including sample id. The number of rows is equal to the number of samples.}

\item{rnum}{the number of regions for uniformly dividing the x-axis for gene length normalization. Default is 100.}

\item{method}{1 and 2 return the raw read depth and the interpolated read depth at the normalized genomic position, respectively. Default is 1.}

\item{winSize}{window size of the rolling window. Default is 20.}

\item{egPct}{edge percent (one-side) to calculate the trimmed mean. Default is 10.}

\item{cases}{a vector of specific samples among all samples in pileup. If NULL, all samples are selected. Default is NULL.}

\item{Study}{a character of study abbreviation in the pileupList. Default is NULL.}

\item{outFile}{a directory with a file name to save outputs}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns NULL; results are saved to \code{outFile}.
